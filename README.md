# vim-dirvish-repo

Browse a repository like a local filesystem using dirvish

# Recommended accompanying plugins

vim-dirvish-repo has no hard dependencies, but I'd recommend you use these plugins.

* [vim-dirvish](https://github.com/justinmk/vim-dirvish)
    * Not actually required, but provides syntax highlighting and some
      assistance maps. vim-dirvish-repo is intended to behave like dirvish but
      in repo-space.
* [itchy.vim](https://github.com/idbrii/itchy.vim)
    * Nicer scratch split for the browser window.
